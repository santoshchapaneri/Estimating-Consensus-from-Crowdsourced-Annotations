# EstimatingConsensus

Outcome: Paper published at IEEE Intl. Conference, 
Received the Best Paper Award

-- Regression task

-- AMG and DEAM music emotion dataset

-- Each music clip is annotated by several annotators on the Valence-Arousal 2D plane

-- Goal is to obtain the estimated music VA consensus from the annotators data

-- Problem is solved by learning the adversariness, biasness and reliability of each annotator

-- Solution is obtained via an Expectation-Maximization (EM) iterative algorithm
